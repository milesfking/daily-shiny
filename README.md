# "On This Day": Informational Shiny App

This project was created to showcase information from a variety of public APIs integreated through a Shiny app in R. App users are prompted to input a date and are subsequently presented with an assortment of information about that date in time. The app aims to inform users on what may have happened that day in a casual and visually appealing way.

This information is pulled from APIs and is categorized based on its content (Astrology, News, Sports, etc.). The APIs that are utilized are as follows:
  - The NASA API
  - The New York Times API
  - The NBA API
  - The Random Fact API
